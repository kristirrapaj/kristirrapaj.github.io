## About me
My name is Kristi. I was born in Albania, and in early 2017 I decided to move to Italy to complete my studies. In 2020, with a great passion for videogames, I decided to join THESIGN Academy in Florence for the course of Game Programming. In these three years, along with my classmates, I have created and developed many different projects with different themes and feautures.
